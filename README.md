## Hop

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/jo-va/hop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jo-va/hop)

It is a work in progress. Some of the current features are:
- OBJ model loading
- Instancing
- Data driven configuration via Lua
- Interactive rendering
- Depth of field

Since I am developping on Linux, the code is targeted to Linux platforms for now, but supporting Windows/Mac OS should not be too difficult.
