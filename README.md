## Hop

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/jo-va/hop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jo-va/hop)

Hop aims to be a C++ path-tracer.
It is a work in progress. Its current features are:
- OBJ model loading
- Instancing
- Lua scripting to define the scene
- Interactive rendering

Since I am developping on Linux, the code is targeted to Linux platforms for now, but supporting Windows/Mac OS should not be too difficult.
